## Notes

## this is the source code of UXBERT test detailed as follows:

Use ReactJS, Reactstrap, SCSS, and hooks to do the following

1 - Create a registration page with email, full name, password, and gender (as radio buttons)
2 - Use form validation to validate each input (email is email, full name is at least 3 characters, the password needs to have at least a letter and a number with a minimum of 6 characters)
3 - For the previous task, it's recommended to use the react-hooks-form library
3 - When you click submit, it should redirect you to the profile page, and display the information you added in the registration form.
4 - For the previous task, redux is a must, (using persist is a bonus)
5 - Use SCSS theming to update the bootstrap theme
6 - Make sure to separate the form into components, it's a critical step.
7 - Using NextJS is a huge bonus, using protected routes in NextJS is another bonus,
